# Café Data Visualization in Dali 大理古城数据可视化分析
## Introduction
* **Project Time:** 08.2018
* **Theme:** Café Data Visualization in Dali
* **Objective：** During 07.2018-10.2018, I worked as an internship in Dali Senario Design Studio. I found architectures here met the diffucult to do location analysis, because it is difficult for them to collect informantion on the Internet, So I write this script to help them do some data visualization tasks.

## Work Flow
1. Write a crowl to get the locations of Café in Dali ancient city from website"大众点评"
2. Use Baidu map API to transfer these locations to **Longitudinal and Latitude Information** and saved as excel
3. Use Python package folium to project these points on the map
